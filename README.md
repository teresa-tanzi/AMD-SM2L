# amd-sm2l
Project for the courses "Algorithms for Massive Datasets" and " Statistical Methods for Machine Learning", a.y. 2019/2020.

This repository contains two main files:
- teresa_tanzi_AMD_SMML.ipynb is a Jupyter Notebook containing the project's code.
- household_ridfe_regression_teresa_tanzi.pdf contains the relative report.

The code automatically downloads the dataset from Kaggle. Before execute the code, it is necessary to configure the Kaggle's API, following the instrictions reported in [kaggle-api](https://github.com/Kaggle/kaggle-api).

Note that, in order to properly execute the project the following python packages should be installed: numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, pyspark and kaggle. Moreover, it is required Spark 2 (the version used in this project is Spark 2.4.5).
