# amd-sm2l
Project for the courses "Algorithms for Massive Datasets" and " Statistical Methods for Machine Learning".

In order to properly execute the project the following python packages should be installed:
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- pyspark
- kaggle

Spark version 2 is required (in the project I used version 2.4.5).

To download the dataset from Kaggle, it is necessary to have a Kaggle account. Then, from the account page it is possible to generate an API token. This operation triggers the generation of a file kaggle.json than can be downloaded. This file shall be moved to the direcotry ~/.kaggle.
